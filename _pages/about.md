My name is Mason, but a few people close to me just call me Mas. I'm currently a post-bacc at the National Institute of Child and Human Development (NICHD). I've recently moved to the tropical Washington DC area from the figid Minneapolis/St. Paul area. I received my B.S. in neuroscience from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities (UMN) College of Biological Sciences and am currently intersted in pursuing an M.S. in genetic counseling.

My current lab is looking into the physiology and treatements of lysosomal storage disorders. At the UMN, I worked on the effects of dopamine receptor activation in the role of striatal development. My roles in these labs centered around immunohistochemistry and microscope imaging. 

After spending the past 5 years at a bench, I'm now ready to start working more with people and patients. My history in customer service and hospitality have shown me the joys (and sometime struggles) of working face-to-face with people. I like talking with people and using interpersonal communicaion to help find ways in solving their problems. 

Outside of work and study, I have a passion for music. I'm currently being self-taught on the acoustic guitar. In the past, I've had experience in learning the piano and violin. I also enjoy scouting out new areas in the city and finding dive bars, brewerys, and distilleries to frequent.
